## DATA624 - Project #2 - Requirements

You are given a simple data set from a beverage manufacturing company. It consists of 2,571 rows/cases of data and 33 columns/variables. Your goal is to use this data to predict **pH** (a column in the set). Potential for hydrogen (pH) is a measure of acidity/alkalinity; it must conform within a critical range and therefore it is important to understand its influence and predict its values. This is production data. pH is a KPI, Key Performance Indicator.

You are also given a scoring set (267 cases). All variables other than the dependent or target. You will use this data to score your model with your best predictions.

## Submission

You are to submit a professional, easy-to-read report. The consumers of this report are executives, data scientists, and engineers. You need to communicate to all audiences; therefore, you cannot just present a technical report. You should provide commentary on your approach, why you are taking this approach, and your findings along the way. The report should be very easy to navigate, follow, and understand. You must explain what/how/why and submit your scored results. Your representative will submit the materials to me in an email with a minimum of two attachments — a Word-readable document (Report), an Excel-readable document (my XLS to you with the predictions), all as before. I will need your R code in the Word document in the text or as an appendix so I can reproduce the results. An R Markdown file is appreciated but not required. Please include all libraries you are using — all code from A to Z and the code should be well documented as if you are passing it off to a production engineer.

Note the modeling/scoring in this exercise is not really that difficult. You can differentiate your team in your report.

## Grading Rubric

* Report Clarity / Readability: 40
* Report Content (Discussion): 20
* Report and Project Completeness (weighted across other categories)
* Report and Project Technical Competency: 20
* Scored Results (MAPE): 20

## Some Additional Thoughts

* How will you handle new predictions with missing values? Never-seen inputs?
* What are the most important predictors? Can you represent visual relationships?
* If you were an engineer, how would you change your work given your analytic results?

## Bonus Potential – 10 Percent

Approach the analysis problem with R and Python. R is required. You must compare and contrast R vs. Python results in detail for full credit.
